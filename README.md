# FinalProject-Quiz-SDEV200
Final Project Repository
Hello. This is my Final Project for SDEV200 Intro to Java Programming. I do hope I did this correctly as I am a bit afraid to admit, but this gaveme a big of a bigger headache then I originally planned it to be. Having issues with Spring Boot and then having to change plans going from a Memory game to making almost a School application Gradebook. I was just very happy how it had turned out and I will take any points I get from this.
